# Quadratic Equation Solver

This application solves quadratic equations of the form:

`ax² + bx + c = 0`

where `a`, `b`, and `c` are real numbers, with `a ≠ 0`.

## How to Build and Run 
Make sure you have Python installed on your OS:
```bash
python --version 
```
Download ```main.py``` file or clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ratarekko/MTRPZ_lab1
```
**The app supports two modes: interactive – enter coefficients via the console and non-interactive (file) mode – read coefficients from a file.**

Run in interactive mode:
```bash
python main.py
```
  Run in non-interactive mode (file input)
```bash
python main.py test.txt
```

## File Format for Non-Interactive Mode

The file must contain three numbers a b c, separated by a single space.
Example input file:

```
5 6 1
```
